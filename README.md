# INTERACTIVE ART GENERATOR USING MACHINE LEARNING
## Created by Didrik Wiig-Andersen

In this python project I have used a machine learning library called **Samila** to automatically create abstract art pieces. The program is interactive in such a way that the user can specify which color the art piece will be generated in. The art piece will be automatically downloaded to your specified folder at the end of the program cyclus. 

```
Welcome to the art generator! Please specify a color: blue
